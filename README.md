Author: Kriston Sanders

<h2> Purpose </h2>
Internal Purchase Admin is intended to assist budget managers in lare organizations, such as a university, authorize and track internal spending for services, such as a campus book store, with internal GL (general ledger) accounts. Features available to managers:<br>
- Add/remove users to internal accounts
- Audit usage<br>
- Track account membership changes<br>

<h2> Status </h2>
At this stage, only the data access layer that creates SQL Server tables and seeds them with data has been uploaded. This is to avoid the need to weed through auto-generated code to find original code that showcases the skills of the author. As the project becomes more complete, additional files will be added so that the application can be run.
